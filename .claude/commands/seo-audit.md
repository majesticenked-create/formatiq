# /seo-audit

**Usage:** `/seo-audit {url}` | `/seo-audit {url} --depth {content|competitive|full}`

Run a tiered SEO audit on a URL or domain.

---

## Trigger Conditions

- User runs `/seo-audit` explicitly
- User asks to "audit", "check SEO", or "run an SEO check" on a URL
- After publishing any new page (auto T2 check)
- Quarterly review cycle (T4 full audit)

---

## Procedure

### Step 1: Determine Audit Tier

| Flag | Tier | Scope |
|------|------|-------|
| (none) | T1 | Quick technical check — 5-10 min |
| `--depth content` | T2 | Content SEO audit — 15-30 min |
| `--depth competitive` | T3 | Competitive analysis — 30-60 min |
| `--depth full` | T4 | Full strategic audit — 60-120 min |

T1 is always run first. T2 builds on T1. T3 builds on T1+T2. T4 builds on all previous tiers.

### Step 2: Invoke seo-agent

Spawn the `seo-agent` with the URL and tier. Pass the full command including flags.

**What to tell the seo-agent:**
```
Run a T{N} SEO audit on {url}.
Read your MEMORY.md first — check for any prior audit data on this domain.
Follow the Tiered Audit System in your instructions for T{N}.
Output the result using the T{N} format specification.
After completing, update your MEMORY.md with the audit results.
```

### Step 3: Review Output

The seo-agent returns the formatted audit output. Review for:
- All checks completed at the tier level
- Every finding includes a specific remediation
- Metrics cited with sources
- Output format matches tier specification

### Step 4: Display Results

Present the full audit output to the user.

For T1/T2: Ask if they want to go deeper (`--depth content`, `--depth competitive`, or `--depth full`).
For T3: Ask if they want a full strategic audit (`--depth full`).
For T4: Offer to build a content calendar or link building roadmap based on the findings.

### Step 5: Update Task Board

If the audit produced FAIL verdicts or critical findings, add the priority fixes to `Task Board.md` under **Today** or **This Week** based on severity.

```

```

**T2 adds:**

```

**T3 adds:**
```
Keyword gaps: {N} | Backlink gap: {N} | SERP features: {owned/available}

```

**T4 adds:**

```

## Notes

- Always starts at T1 regardless of depth flag — tiers are cumulative
- If GSC is not configured, note the data gap but proceed with available tools
- For T4, expect the session to run long — suggest `/safe-clear` before starting if context is already heavy
